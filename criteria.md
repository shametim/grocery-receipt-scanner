problem is that we need a way to scan a grocery store receipt and track the line items

success metric: can i take a photo of a receipt and scan it to

KPI: how much money can we save users by offering suggestion from items in nearby stores

parsing - landing ai

indexing - fixed json schema of item name, quantity, price, store, date

retrieval - fetch by item name, fetch by day

actions - scan a receipt

latency - landing ai is hopefully fast

privacy - you can enable data sharing checkbox which will let you share your data and enable you to see discounts

use of landing ai - yes
use of pathway - used to ingest live prices and give realtime queryin capability
